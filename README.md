# libft.a
During this project, I re-implemented a minimal static version of libc, the C standard library. It taught me about how C programs work under the hood and how the standard library functions are implemented. finding about the difference between static and dynamic libraries, gained a btter understanding of I/O, memory management, and string manipulation in C, and re-implemented functions such as calloc(), atoi(), and itoa(). i surely now give a greater appreciation for how they work and how they are used in C programs. Overall, I was amazed at how much can be done with just a few basic functions.
